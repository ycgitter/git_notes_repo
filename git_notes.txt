Using diff - comparing working version with new version minimizes the amount of code to look at which helps spot where an error may have been introduced.

Keeping versions of code helps backtrack to versions that had particular features working.

To configure WinMergeU as difftool
Put this in c:\Users\Yeida\.gitconfig
    [diff]
        tool = winmerge
    [difftool "winmerge"]
        cmd = "'C:/Program Files/WinMerge-2.0.14/WinMergeU.exe'" -u -e "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"
