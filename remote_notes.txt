Set up a remote repository on GitHub if you want a central repository that can be accessed from different computers, or by other collaborators.

Generally want to push and pull remote manually so you have control over when these occur.
If you're in the middle of making changes, you probably don't want to have the confusion 
of new code coming and going, dealing with merges/merge conflicts, etc.

Forking a repository - clone a repository already on GitHub into a new repository on GitHub,
but with the ability to push to and pull from the original repository.

Fork - create a clone of a repo on GitHub.  Do this if you need a central repo
       for collaboration or if working from different computers.
Clone - copy of a repo.  Can be a local copy of remote GitHub repo, 
        or local copy of local repo.
        Can push back easily to repo you own, but need additional steps to push back to
        a repo owned by someone else.
Branch - for experimenting or side project on local repo
